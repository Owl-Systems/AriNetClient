# AriNetClient  
### Modern WebSocket Event Client for PBX Systems (.NET)

AriNetClient is a **modern, event-driven, strongly-typed WebSocket client** designed to integrate PBX systems (such as **Wazo** and **Asterisk**) into **ASP.NET Core / Web API** applications.

The library abstracts all WebSocket complexity and exposes PBX events as **clean domain events**, allowing developers to focus purely on **business logic**.

---

## 🚀 Why AriNetClient?

Traditional PBX integrations require developers to:
- Manually manage WebSocket connections
- Parse raw JSON messages
- Handle reconnections and failures
- Mix infrastructure logic with business logic

**AriNetClient solves this by design.**

> You never deal with WebSockets, JSON, or server-specific formats.  
> You only handle **strongly-typed events**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Strongly typed domain events
- ✅ Event-driven architecture (similar to AsterNET.ARI, but modern)
- ✅ Built-in Dependency Injection support
- ✅ Automatic event dispatching
- ✅ Multiple handlers per event
- ✅ BackgroundService friendly
- ✅ Auto-reconnect and fault tolerance
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Extensible for multiple PBX servers

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

> **Unify your domain, not the PBX servers**

Each PBX server emits different event names and payloads.  
AriNetClient normalizes them into **domain-level events** that your application depends on.

### Responsibility Boundaries

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-----|---------------|
| WebSocketClient | Connection lifecycle |
| Event Parser | Parse raw server messages |
| Event Adapter | Convert to domain events |
| Event Dispatcher | Route events |
| Event Handlers | Business logic |
| Your App | CRM, Billing, Rules, Notifications |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### appsettings.json

{
  "Wazo": {
    "WebSocket": {
      "Url": "wss://your-wazo-server:443/ari/events",
      "AuthToken": "your-auth-token",
      "ApplicationName": "my-web-api-app",
      "AutoReconnect": true
    }
  }
}

---
## 🏁 Getting Started
> **Register the WebSocket Client**
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddWebSocketClient(
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("Wazo:WebSocket")
);

>**Create a Strongly-Typed Event Handler**

public class CallStartedHandler 
    : BaseEventHandler<CallStartedEvent>
{
    private readonly ILogger<CallStartedHandler> _logger;

    public CallStartedHandler(
        ILogger<CallStartedHandler> logger)
        : base(logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    protected override async Task ProcessEventAsync(
        CallStartedEvent @event,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation(
            "📞 Incoming call from {Caller}",
            @event.CallerNumber
        );

        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
